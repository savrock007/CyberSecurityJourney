# 🛡️ CyberSec Journey — Labs, Research, and Projects

Welcome to my personal cybersecurity lab and research repository. This repo documents everything I do across the security field — from hands-on homelab infrastructure to offensive and defensive tooling, writeups, and vulnerability research.

This is my long-term space for tracking progress, experimenting with new ideas, and building a strong offensive and defensive security skillset.
